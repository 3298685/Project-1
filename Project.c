Task = 3    Substitution Cipher Encryption with key.
Task = 4    Substitution Cipher Decryption with key.

To input any text into the functions the file "input.txt" must be modified.
The caesar cipher will read an integer key between 0 and 26 from the first line.
All functions will read the message to be encrypted/decrypted from the second line.
The substitution cipher will read its key from the third line.
